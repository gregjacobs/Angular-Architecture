	<p>
		These are general guides about AngularJS development, architecture,
		testing, and general best practices that I've developed over the years
		which have proven to be highly effective for writing large software
		applications with the framework.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Note</strong>: This is not so much a site for Angular tutorials
		or getting started guides, but rather one for effectively building large,
		maintainable, and testable applications with AngularJS. These guides may
		not quite make sense just yet if you're new to Angular, but come back
		once you have understood the basics and are now taking on a project of
		sufficient size (maybe 7-10+ pages, view components, etc.).
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Note #2</strong>: These guides are based on Angular 1.x. However,
		many of the same high-level concepts remain the same for Angular 2.0.
		You will just need to translate the examples into Angular 2.0 code.
	</p>

	<p>
		Please feel free to ask questions, contribute your own ideas/input (I'm
		always looking to make things better), and even pull request changes to
		the site on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gregjacobs/Angular-Guides" target="_blank">repo</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I hope these guides help to make your AngularJS apps more robust, more
		maintainable, and generally easier/faster to add features to as the size
		of your projects grow. Enjoy.
