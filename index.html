		Welcome to my site for Angular guides. These are general guides about
		AngularJS development, architecture, testing, and general best practices
		developed over the years, and which have proven to be highly effective for
		writing large software applications.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note: This is so much a site for Angular tutorials or getting started
		guides, but rather one for effectively building large, maintainable, and
		testable applications with AngularJS. These guides may not quite make
		sense just yet if you're just learning Angular, but come back once you
		have understood the basics of Angular and are now taking on a project of
		sufficient size (7-10+ pages, components, etc.).
	</p>

	<p>
		Please feel free to ask questions, contribute your own ideas (I'm always
		looking to make things better), and even pull request changes to the
		site on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/gregjacobs/Angular-Guides" target="_blank">repo</a>.
