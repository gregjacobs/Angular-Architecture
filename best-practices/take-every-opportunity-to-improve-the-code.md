Whether it is to better organize the code, add tests, clean up old code, etc. 
Moving to a better / more maintainable codebase is a constantly ongoing process 
that should happen every day during development.

Don’t worry about making a pull request a little more complicated – we’re
looking for the best end state here. However, if the changes are large, you
could pull request the reorganization/refactoring commit(s) separately, and
then the new feature/bugfix after. Just about every change to the codebase 
should involve a little bit of refactoring/cleanup/addition of tests, and then 
the addition of the new feature being developed.
